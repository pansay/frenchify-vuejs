VueJS implementation of [Frenchify](https://github.com/pansay/frenchify-rules) library.

## Known issues

* Works on Chrome, doesn't work on Firefox because they haven't implemented ES2018 yet and Babel doesn't emulate it properly (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53136406/babel-implementation-of-es2018-regexp-lookbehind-assertions). Haven't tested other browsers.
